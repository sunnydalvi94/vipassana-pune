				<button class="accordion">Why is the course ten days long?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Actually, the ten-day course is the minimum; it provides an essential introduction
						and foundation to the technique. To develop in the practice is a lifetime job. Experience
						over generations has shown that if Vipassana is taught in periods of less than ten
						days, the student does not get a sufficient experiential grasp of the technique.
						Traditionally, Vipassana was taught in retreats lasting seven weeks. With the dawning
						of the 20th century, the teachers of this tradition began to experiment with shorter
						times to suit the quickening pace of life. They tried thirty days, two weeks, ten
						days, down to seven days--and they found that less than ten days is not enough time
						for the mind to settle down and work deeply with the mind-body phenomenon.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">How many hours a day will I be meditating?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						The day begins at 4:00 a.m. with a wakeup bell and continues until 9:00 p.m. There
						are about ten hours of meditation throughout the day, interspersed with regular
						breaks and rest periods. Every evening at 7:00 p.m. there is a videotaped lecture
						by the Teacher, S.N. Goenka, which provides a context for meditators to understand
						their experience of the day. This schedule has proved workable and beneficial for
						hundreds of thousands of people for decades.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">What language is used in the course?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						The teaching is given through recordings of S.N. Goenka, speaking in English or
						Hindi, together with a translation into a local language. Tape translations exist
						in most of the major languages of the world, including English. If the teachers
						conducting a course do not speak the local language fluently, interpreters will
						be there to help. Language is usually no barrier for someone who wants to join a
						course.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">How much does the course cost?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Each student who attends a Vipassana course is given this gift by a previous student.
						There is no charge for either the teaching, or for room and board. All Vipassana
						courses worldwide are run on a strictly voluntary donation basis. At the end of
						your course, if you have benefited from the experience, you are welcome to donate
						for the coming course, according to your volition and your means.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">How much are teachers paid to conduct courses?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Teachers receive no payment, donations or other material benefit. They are required
						to have their own private means of support. This rule means that some of them may
						have less time for teaching, but it protects students from exploitation and it guards
						against commercialism. In this tradition, teachers give Vipassana purely as a service
						to others. All they get is the satisfaction of seeing people's happiness at the
						end of ten days.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">I can't sit cross legged. Can I meditate?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Certainly. Chairs are provided for those unable to sit comfortably on the floor
						because of age or a physical problem.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">I'm on a special diet. Can I bring my own food?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						If your doctor has prescribed a special diet, let us know and we will see whether
						we can provide what you need. If the diet is too specialized or would interfere
						with meditation, we might have to ask you to wait until you can be more flexible.
						We're sorry but students are required to choose from the food provided to them,
						rather than bring food for themselves. Most people find the choice is ample and
						they enjoy the simple vegetarian diet.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Can pregnant women attend courses? Are there any special arrangements or instructions
				for them?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Pregnant women may certainly attend, and many women come specifically during pregnancy
						to take advantage of the opportunity to work deeply and in silence during this special
						time. We ask pregnant women to ensure they are confident that their pregnancy is
						stable before applying. We provide the extra food they need and ask them to work
						in a relaxed way.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Why is a course conducted in silence?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						All students attending the course observe "noble silence" â€” that is, silence of
						body, speech and mind. They agree to refrain from communicating with their co-meditators.
						However, students are free to contact the management about their material needs,
						and to speak with the instructor. Silence is observed for the first nine full days.
						On the tenth day, speech is resumed as a way of re-establishing the normal pattern
						of daily life. Continuity of practice is the secret of success in this course; silence
						is an essential component in maintaining this continuity.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">How can I be sure I am capable of doing the meditation?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						For a person in reasonable physical and mental health who is genuinely interested
						and willing to make a sincere effort, meditation (including "noble silence") is
						not difficult. If you are able to follow the instructions patiently and diligently,
						you can be sure of tangible results. Though it may appear daunting, the day's schedule
						is neither too severe nor too relaxed. Moreover, the presence of other students
						practicing conscientiously in a peaceful and conducive atmosphere lends tremendous
						support to one's efforts.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Is there anyone who should not participate in a course?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Obviously someone who is physically too weak to follow the schedule will not be
						able to benefit from a course. The same is true of someone suffering from psychiatric
						problems, or someone undergoing emotional upheaval. Through a process of questions
						and answers, we will be able to help you decide clearly beforehand whether you are
						in a position to benefit fully from a course. In some cases applicants are asked
						to get approval from their doctor before they can be accepted.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Can Vipassana cure physical or mental diseases?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Many diseases are caused by our inner agitation. If the agitation is removed, the
						disease may be alleviated or disappear. But learning Vipassana with the aim of curing
						a disease is a mistake that never works. People who try to do this waste their time
						because they are focusing on the wrong goal. They may even harm themselves. They
						will neither understand the meditation properly nor succeed in getting rid of the
						disease.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">How about depression? Does Vipassana cure that?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Again, the purpose of Vipassana is not to cure diseases. Someone who really practices
						Vipassana learns to be happy and balanced in all circumstances. But a person with
						a history of severe depression may not be able to apply the technique properly and
						may not get the desired results. The best thing for such a person is to work with
						a health professional. Vipassana teachers are meditation experts, not psychotherapists.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Can Vipassana make people mentally unbalanced?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						No. Vipassana teaches you to be aware and equanimous, that is, balanced, despite
						all the ups and downs of life. But if someone comes to a course concealing serious
						emotional problems, that person may be unable to understand the technique or to
						apply it properly to achieve the desired results. This is why it is important to
						let us know your past history so that we can judge whether you will benefit from
						a course.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Do I have to be a Buddhist to practice Vipassana?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						People from many religions and no religion have found the meditation course helpful
						and beneficial. Vipassana is an art of living, a way of life. While it is the essence
						of what the Buddha taught, it is not a religion; rather, it is the cultivation of
						human values leading to a life which is good for oneself and good for others.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Why do I have to stay for the entire ten days?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Vipassana is taught step by step, with a new step added each day to the end of the
						course. If you leave early, you do not learn the full teaching and do not give the
						technique a chance to work for you. Also, by meditating intensively, a course participant
						initiates a process that reaches fulfillment with the completion of the course.
						Interrupting the process before completion is not advisable.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Is it dangerous to leave a course early?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						The point is that leaving early is shortchanging yourself. You don't give yourself
						a chance to learn the full technique and so you won't be able to apply it successfully
						in daily life. You also interrupt the process in the middle rather than letting
						it come to the proper conclusion. To get home a day or two early, you waste all
						the time you have invested.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">How about the tenth day, when talking is allowed and serious meditation stops? Can
				I leave then?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						The tenth day is a very important transition back to ordinary life. No one is permitted
						to leave on that day.
					</p>
